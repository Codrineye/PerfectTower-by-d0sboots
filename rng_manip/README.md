It automatically starts in tower testing, will exit if you don't have Rak's Curse in your BP, and will also exit
as soon as it finished getting 5 stacks, which should only take a few seconds. Aside from the parts that are macro-generated
by the rng\_manip library, it should be pretty straightforward to understand and incorporate yourself if you want to.

It'll be easier to understand by looking at the source code (scroll down a bit here.)

## Library workspace

To use the library yourself, you'll need to import the source. The workspace
import comes with two example scripts, which you can delete if you don't want/need.
Explanation for how to use the library is in the comments of the rnglib script.

```
{"workspaces":{"rng_manip":[["rnglib","; This library exists to do RNG manipulation in TPT2. If you don't know what RNG manipulation is,\n; you can find plenty of info on the web, but also this library is probably not for you.\n\n; Stub needed to make the macros not error during the examples\n{lua(function rng_code() end)}\n\n; There are three sets of macros defined in this library. The first is the 3-part rng_init sequence:\n#rng_init1 {lua(return rng_code(\"init1\"))}\n#rng_init2 {lua(return rng_code(\"init2\"))}\n#rng_init3(label) {lua(return rng_code(\"init3\",[[{label}]]))}\n; To use these, place this sequence *immediately* before the event you want to manipulate.\n; {rng_init1}\n; {rng_init2}\n; {rng_init3(continue)}\n; continue:\n;\n; The last one takes a label to goto to when it is done. You can define the label on the next\n; line if you just want it to continue there. You can also use more complicated conditional\n; expressions if you want.\n;\n; It is important that you run this in the same frame as the event you are trying to manipulate,\n; ideally right before, so that other calls to the rng do not happen in-between.\n;\n; If you need to re-initialize the state, jump to :rng_reinit. Don't include this block twice,\n; because it expands to a very large amount of code.\n\n; To simulate future rolls of the rng, use this macro:\n#rng_next {lua(return rng_code(\"next\"))}\n; You will need to call this (at least) once before calling rng_getint. Every call to {rng_next}\n; should correspond to one call to the RNG (generally via rnd()), except for the last one(s) which\n; you want to save for the actual in-game event(s) that are rolling the RNG.\n\n; This macro converts the simulated state to a 32-bit integer.\n#rng_getint {lua(return rng_code(\"getint\"))}\n#rng_getdouble {lua(return rng_code(\"getdouble\"))}\n; Don't forget that you need one call to {rng_next} before the result will be valid.\n; {rng_getint} will potentially be negative if the high bit is set. {rng_getdouble} avoids\n; this issue by using a double, so the result will always be a non-negative integer.\n\n; This simulates the same behavior as the rnd() function.\n#rng_getrange(min, max) {lua(return rng_code(\"getrange\",[[{min}]],[[{max}]]))}\n; The range is inclusive. Just like with {rng_getint}, {rng_next} needs to be called\n; before this is valid.\n\n; ==========================================================================================\n; ================================= IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS =================================\n; ==========================================================================================\n\n; Change this to \"global\" for debugging\n#rng_local local\n\n\n; The 128-bit state of the rng, stored as 128 \"1\"s and \"0\"s.\n; It is exactly as pathetic as it sounds, but it is actually most efficient to compute\n; xor and bitshifting with numbers in string form, because we can do xor via\n; precomputed tables and bitshifts become (sub)string manipulation.\n; You'd think the same could be done with integers with * and /, but the fact that we only\n; have signed integers makes everything too awful.\n; This is used by {rng_next} to compute the next state, and {rng_getint} to convert to a number.\n; You can copy this elsewhere and restore it later if you want to simulate multiple rng seeds at once.\n:{rng_local} string rng_state\n\n; A temporary variable used during int-to-binary conversion. A double is used to avoid issues\n; with the sign bit.\n:{rng_local} double rng_r\n\n\n; The structure of the code is broken up into multiple Lua functions, to allow regular\n; comments to explain them at the top of each. Lua functions are used to construct the code,\n; instead of regular macros, so that we could define our user-visible macros such as\n; {rng_init1}, {rng_next} etc. at the top without having to give the full implementation;\n; instead, a stub implementation was given and then the function is re-implemented at the\n; bottom of the file here. This allows us to use the macros freely in comments, since macros\n; are always expanded, where otherwise we could not comment on them before they were defined.\n; As a side benefit, before the full definition takes effect they will expand to nothing,\n; which is very fast to evaluate.\n\n; This constructs the data string that will be used to initialize our lookup tables.\n; The data string is 256 entries, each 23 bytes long:\n; * 8 bytes for the name suffix of \"rng_from\"\n; * 11 bytes for the entire name of the xor table (entries like \"0001xor0110\")\n; * 4 bytes for the value of the xor table\n; All these strings are binary strings (the characters \"0\" and \"1\"), except also containing\n; \"xor\" in the name for the xor table.\n{lua(function rng_getLookupString()\\\n  local codetable = {}\\\n  local conv4 = {}\\\n  for i=0, 15 do\\\n    local bin = \"\"\\\n    local idx = i\\\n    for j=0, 3 do\\\n      bin = bin .. string.char((i>>3) + 48)\\\n      i = (i<<1) & 15\\\n    end\\\n    conv4[idx] = bin\\\n  end\\\n  for i=0, 255 do\\\n    codetable[i*3+1] = conv4[i>>4] .. conv4[i&15]\\\n    codetable[i*3+2] = conv4[i>>4] .. \"xor\" .. conv4[i&15]\\\n    codetable[i*3+3] = conv4[(i>>4) ~ (i&15)]\\\n  end\\\n  return table.concat(codetable)\\\nend\\\n)}\n\n; This constructs the code for the three rng_init macros. The code for these is truly awful,\n; because what should be ~7 lines has been crammed into the minimum possible of 3 lines to\n; save space in user code.\n;\n; At a high level, {rng_init1} is a local.int.set, {rng_init2} is a local.string.set,\n; and {rng_init3()} is a goto. Each of these performs multiple different functions depending on\n; the phase of execution; they act together as a state machine in order to initialize everything\n; that needs initialization.\n;\n; The first phase is setting the \"rng_from\" and \"xor\" tables. Both of these tables have 256 entries,\n; and the data for them is encoded together in a string that we calculate and store as \"codetable\".\n; In this phase, we first assign the codetable data to rng_state, and then use entries from it to\n; set rng_from (an double table) and xor (a string table). We use substring to discard the front of\n; rng_state, which is the current working entry, to both load a new entry and also because the length\n; of rng_state also functions as the way to calculate the value we assign to rng_from.\n;\n; The second phase is used to read 4 values from the rng and convert them into individual bits.\n; It lasts for 128 iterations as a result. We use either\n; contains(local.string.get(\"1111xor1111\", \"0\")) (the final table entry) or\n; contains(rng_state, \"xor\") to determine when the first phase is over;\n; the two have slight differences at both the start and end of phase 1 which dictate the use\n; of one or the other in specific places.\n;\n; Reading bits is relatively straightforward: A value from rnd() is stored in rng_r and then\n; is multiplied by an appropriate power of 2 to check the sign bit. There is an additional quirk\n; where if the value is exactly 0, it indicates a condition where we have to restart the process.\n; This is because the nature of rnd() is that it adds one to range_max, so there is a hole where\n; both 0 and 2^32-1 map to the same value and we cannot distinguish them. Since this is very\n; rare, we just restart in this case and roll again.\n;\n; Tricks that are used: Since contains(\"\", \"\") is true, contains(\"\", var) is a cheap test for\n; if a variable is unset. Also, since if() and boolean logic have the same number of nodes,\n; sometimes ternaries are used to slightly optimize node counts.\n{lua(function rng_codeCacheSetInit(cache)\\\n  local codetable = rng_getLookupString()\\\n--[[\\\nIf we are in phase 1, set rng_from appropriately.
